# tabletop_character_randomizer

This is a D&D 5e character creator based off of the free information found
at http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop/players-basic-rules

The goal of the project is to randomizer your Characters race, class, spells, and chosen items.
Each characters stats will be rolled and randomized and the user can distribute the stats they choose.
Finally the traits of each race will be displayed for them accordingly. 

This is just a fun little project for me to create, work and build on.
